# uxento-firefox

**Since Uxento is being developed and currently only supports Chrome, I decided to port it to Firefox.**

I **DID NOT** completely rewrite the extension as I do not have access to the source code, this is merely a workaround to make the extension work on Firefox.

### Installation Instructions
1. Go to about:config and change the xpinstall.signatures.required to False (only for release builds of firefox, for Firefox Nightly and Developer Edition not needed)
2. Clone this repository (or download the zip file)
3. Go to manage addons in firefox and click on "Install Add-on From File"
4. Select the downloaded zip file and click on "Install" (or first add the files to a zip file)
5. The addon should now be installed and ready to use.

### Known issue
~~Uxento data (CA group data, TG group data, silver/gold border) not showing~~ Fixed

If any issues arise with the extension, please report them in the official [discord server](https://discord.gg/uxento) for uxtension as I am not the developer of the extension.
